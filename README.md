# StackOverflowSDK
This is a demo project. It contains the stackoverflow framework. This framework helps to work with stackoverflow API: http://api.stackexchange.com/docs

How to use this framework:
1. Build in XCode for all configurations (iphone 5 sim/iphone 6 sim/device)
2. Locate framework in Finder
3. Copy create_fat_framework.sh to project Derived Data folder
4. Run create_fat_framework.sh
5. Copy framework to your own project


There aren't 100% test coverage. But the tests helps me to modify framework.
